# Faux-Battle
Used in a battle simulator to give troops a strategy of attack.

This algorithm works by sorting the enemy troops by each unit’s individual power level. The units individual power level is calculated by the formula: (speed\*1.2 + power\*.8)/currentHP. This prioritizes killing off enemies fastest enemies, unless a unit is very low health. It then takes each of our troops and starts with the highest power enemies and attempts to target them based on if that troop is the best against it or not, if not it attacks it last. It has a runtime complexity of about O(n^2) since we have a for loop within another for loop. This is fine, however, since the number of troops being fed in is small. The space complexity is O(n^2), because I need to store each element into an unordered map with each unit’s orders. The problem with this algorithm is that it won’t find the optimal way to attack to use all the damage available from all the troops. However, I chose this algorithm since it returns the plan extremely quickly which factors into the battle.
